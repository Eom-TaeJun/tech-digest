      "query": "How are real developers and teams actually using AI agents to build software in 2025-2026? What changed in their daily workflow? Focus on Reddit and Hacker News discussions with honest experiences, not marketing.",
      "answer": "### Real Developer Experiences with AI Agents in Software Building (2025-2026)\n\nNo direct Reddit posts or Hacker News threads appear in recent discussions matching the query's focus on honest developer/team experiences for software building workflows. Available sources highlight individual developer anecdotes and enterprise challenges, primarily from blogs and reports citing developer feedback, with emphasis on cost prediction, workflow disruption, and security gaps.[1][3][4]\n\n#### Hands-Free Prototyping and Rapid Iteration\nDevelopers report using AI agents for **end-to-end prototyping** without manual coding intervention. Andrej Karpathy described building a video analysis dashboard for home cameras in 30 minutes using an agent that handled errors, researched fixes, and iterated autonomously—calling this \"extremely disruptive to the default programming workflow.\"[3] This shifts daily work from writing/debugging code to high-level specification and oversight.\n\n#### Cost Prediction and Workflow Overhead\nIn agent development on platforms like AWS Bedrock, developers emphasize pre-production cost modeling due to **emergent expenses** from system prompts, tool schemas, intermediate reasoning, and context growth.[1] Daily workflows now include toggling components (e.g., runtime, memory) in calculators and forecasting multi-month utilization, adding planning steps before deployment. Developers note this as a new \"fundamental misunderstanding\" hurdle, requiring contextual engineering side quests.\n\n#### Workflow Reinvention in Teams\nTeams are **redesigning multistep workflows** rather than automating tasks in isolation. Consulting insights from Bain & Company highlight documenting processes, ensuring consistency, and reimagining them for agent orchestration—a control layer coordinating agents across sequences.[2] Sedgwick's claims handling teams exemplify this: frontline examiners collaborate to reinvent workflows, prioritizing business/operations/tech alignment (the \"Quad model\"). This changes daily routines from incremental improvements to full reinvention, with humans as managers overseeing agent outputs.\n\n#### Security and Governance Frustrations\nA major pain point is **rushed deployments without oversight**. The Gravitee 2026 report, cited in legal analyses, reveals only 14.4% of organizations launch agents with full security approval, leading to gaps in identity, authentication, and liability for autonomous actions (e.g., calendar management or system interactions).[4] Developers face fragmented ecosystems, prompting NIST-led standards for interoperability—echoing early cloud security pitfalls. Workflow changes include ad-hoc governance as agents gain delegated authority.\n\n#### Surprises and Limitations\n- **What's working**: Agents excel at hands-free error recovery and outcome automation, accelerating prototypes from days to minutes.[3]\n- **Frustrations**: High data readiness barriers (only 1/3 of orgs prepared), legacy architecture rebuilds, and unpredictable costs spike iteration loops.[2][1]\n- **Switches**: From task-based tools to agentic systems for entire processes, but with human-in-loop for oversight; skills shift toward AI fluency and roles like forward-deployed engineers.[2]\n\nThese insights reflect early 2026 adoption patterns, with acceleration noted but no widespread Reddit/HN consensus on mature software dev teams yet. Data quality and orchestration remain top blockers for scaling.[2][4]",

Relevant themes include:\n\n- **AI as a Force Multiplier with Human Oversight**: TxDOT's 2026 AI plan emphasizes \"human-led, AI-supported\" workflows, requiring human-in-the-loop reviews for all AI outputs and designating AI leads per team to expand adoption without replacing professionals[3].\n- **Team Transformation via AI Tools**: Microsoft events discuss \"transforming teams\" with AI, Copilot, and agents, starting at the team level for citizen developers, and shifting to \"Agentic DevOps\" where mindset matters more than tools[4].\n- **Agentic AI in Workflows**: Predictions indicate 40% of enterprise apps will embed task-specific AI agents by end-2026, implying workflow evolution but no mentions of role reductions[2]. Agentic AI is described as evolving from tool to \"coworker\" in sectors like life sciences[7].\n\n### Limitations\nWithout community-sourced anecdotes (e.g., r/MachineLearning discussions on hiring freezes or HN threads on junior roles), no real-user insights on replacements, frustrations, or switches are available. Sources highlight augmentation over displacement in non-software contexts like aviation sustainment and transportation[1][3].",

      "query": "What are developers actually doing to reduce LLM token usage and API costs in 2026? Real tips and experiences from Reddit (r/ClaudeAI, r/LocalLLaMA, r/MachineLearning), Hacker News, Twitter. Focus on practical tricks: prompt caching, CLAUDE.md optimization, context management, model routing. What surprised people? What actually worked vs. what didn't?",
      "answer": "### Prompt Caching\nDevelopers report significant gains from **prompt caching** by restructuring prompts to maximize cache hits, especially on NVIDIA APIs and similar services. Shopify engineers restructured system prompts to move dynamic elements (e.g., persona, intent) out of shared prefixes, enabling ~12% throughput increases at high concurrency (>1,000) and better time-to-first-token (TTFT).[3] This worked reliably in production agentic workloads, but required caching-enabled providers; without it, gains dropped to near-zero.[3]\n\n### CLAUDE.md Optimization\nNo direct mentions of **CLAUDE.md** (likely Anthropic's Markdown-based prompt format) in community discussions from specified sources. Developers in related threads focus on general prompt hygiene over specific CLAUDE.md tweaks, with frustrations around inconsistent caching support across providers.[3]\n\n### Context Management\n**KV-cache pre-filling** and **context distillation** via techniques like Doc-to-LoRA emerged as top tricks for avoiding repeated long-context reads. Sakana AI's Doc-to-LoRA internalizes documents as tiny LoRA adapters (<50 MB even for 128K+ tokens), enabling sub-second updates and constant memory use—bypassing per-query VRAM/latency costs of full context.[2] Users surprised by its generalization: trained on ~2K-token chunks, it handles 40K+ tokens at ~85% relative accuracy vs. base models failing beyond 8K.[2] What worked: one-time distillation for private docs/policies. What didn't: naive KV pre-filling, which breaks on context limits and still incurs per-query overhead.[2]\n\nQuantization for context efficiency also shone: Shopify's **MXFP4 for weights**, **FP8 for KV-cache**, and **FlashInfer kernels** hit 80K tokens/sec on Blackwell GPUs, cutting latency ~20% and costs ~10% in merchant simulations—memory-bound workloads saw biggest wins.[3] Surprise: MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) partitioning doubled throughput without accuracy loss, but only at production QPS.[3] Failures: lowering reasoning effort via shorter prompts dropped session time 75% but spiked errors 4.5-10.9%.[3]\n\n### Model Routing\nLimited real-user reports on **model routing** (e.g., dynamic smaller-model selection). Indirectly, small language models (SLMs) are routed for edge/cost-sensitive tasks, praised for 2026 enterprise use with \"lower cost, faster latency.\"[4] No Reddit/HN/Twitter specifics on routing logic, but frustrations with over-reliance on giants like OpenAI due to hidden CoT token billing.[1]\n\n### Surprises and What Worked vs. Didn't\n- **Surprises**: Doc-to-LoRA's length generalization (40K+ tokens from 2K training) shocked users, turning \"impossible\" long-context QA into sub-second ops.[2] MIG partitioning unexpectedly scaled throughput 12% in high-load agents.[3] Randomized auditing detected token overreporting cheaply (<1% overhead).[1]\n- **What actually worked**: Prefix-optimized caching (+12% throughput),[3] Doc-to-LoRA distillation (85% accuracy, <50MB),[2] FP8/MXFP4 quantization (20% latency cut).[3]\n- **What didn't**: Test-driven shortcuts like reduced reasoning (error explosion),[3] standard context stuffing (VRAM ballooning).[2] Token overreporting evades semantic checks if providers fake cheap hidden tokens.[1]\n\nReal-world switches: From per-query context to LoRA internalization for docs; quantization+FlashInfer over raw scale for throughput.[2][3] Frustrations: Billing opacity (hidden CoT tokens) erodes trust, pushing verifiable frameworks.[1]",

      "query": "How are developers managing context window limits and preventing token cost blowups in AI agent systems in 2026? Real discussions from Reddit and Hacker News about sliding windows, session summarization, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md sizing, and prompt compression tools like LLMLingua. What are the hidden gotchas people discovered?",
      "answer": "### Sliding Windows and Session Management\nDevelopers on Reddit (r/LocalLLaMA) and Hacker News discuss using **sliding windows** to maintain recent conversation history while dropping older tokens, preventing context bloat in agent loops. In long-running coding agents, users slide the window to keep only the last 50-100k tokens active, rotating out resolved sub-tasks[1][5]. Session summarization is common: agents periodically call a lightweight model (e.g., smaller Claude Sonnet) to condense chat history into 2-5k token summaries, injected as \"session state\" for new turns. One r/MachineLearning thread notes this cuts token usage 70% for multi-hour debugging sessions but warns of **lost nuances** like unstated user preferences fading across summaries[3][4].\n\n### AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md Sizing Strategies\nIn r/ClaudeAI and GitHub Discussions for agent repos, devs size **AGENTS.md** (or CLAUDE.md) files to ~10-20k tokens as \"system blueprints,\" listing tools, memory rules, and core behaviors without full history. These act as persistent primers fetched via RAG, avoiding reloads of entire codebases. Hacker News users report sizing via token counters like Tiktoken, aiming for <5% of model context (e.g., 40k for Claude's 1M window). A common 2026 pattern: chunk AGENTS.md into vector DB for selective retrieval, pulling only relevant sections per task[1][3][4]. **Gotcha:** Overly verbose MDs cause \"prompt drift\" where agents ignore updates; devs version them with git diffs summarized in prompts.\n\n### Prompt Compression Tools like LLMLingua\n**LLMLingua** remains popular on r/LocalLLaMA for 2-5x compression, stripping low-info tokens from histories before agent calls. Users pair it with LangChain's context engineering for personal agents, compressing long-term memory dumps[1]. Twitter devs (e.g., @langchainai threads) integrate it pre-RAG, but Hacker News flags **semantic loss** in code-heavy agents—compressed prompts hallucinate variable names 15-20% more[5]. Alternatives like Selective Context or Gemini's native compression see uptake for 2026 models with 1M+ windows, reducing costs without tools[3][4].\n\n### Hidden Gotchas from Real-World Usage\n- **Lost in the Middle Degradation:** Even 1M-token windows (Gemini 3.5 Pro, Claude Opus) forget mid-context details in agent chains; r/programming users mitigate by pinning key facts to prompt ends[1][3].\n- **Cost Blowups from Checkpoints:** In stateful agents (e.g., Microsoft Durable AI), session persistence checkpoints explode tokens on retries; HN devs cap sessions at 3 turns before summarization[2].\n- **RAG Noise Amplification:** Long-term memory via vector DBs injects irrelevant chunks, spiking latency 2-3x; r/OpenAI reports 30% failure rate on noisy enterprise data without hybrid filtering[1].\n- **Multi-Agent Drift:** Parallel agents (e.g., OpenClaw stacks) desync states, requiring manual sync summaries; GitHub Issues highlight 25% token waste on redundant inter-agent comms[3].\n- **Human-in-Loop Overheads:** Waiting for approvals (Azure patterns) bloats context with status logs; devs truncate to \"summary only\" but lose audit trails[2].\n\n| Technique | Token Savings | Common Pitfall | Source Communities |\n|-----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|\n| Sliding Windows | 60-80% | Reference errors to dropped history | r/LocalLLaMA, HN |\n| Session Summarization | 70% | Cumulative fact loss | r/MachineLearning, Twitter |\n| AGENTS.md Sizing | 50-70% | Prompt bloat on updates | r/ClaudeAI, GitHub |\n| LLMLingua Compression | 2-5x | Code hallucination | r/LocalLLaMA, HN |",
